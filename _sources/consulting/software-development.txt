.. note:: Meeting participants need not actually stand;
   as in a :ref:`Digital Stand Up Meeting`.


.. index:: Three Questions

Three Questions
`````````````````

 - What did I accomplish yesterday?
 - What will I do today?
 - What obstacles are impeding my progress?

Digital Stand Up Meeting
```````````````````````````

Pros:

* Live docs, team chat logs, and issue/ticket comment threads
  have URIs, are easier to remember,
  and more to the point.
* Easier to prepare for
* More time to read, think, and respond
* More comfortable
* Easier to get up to date with

Cons:

- It's not everyone in the same room
- "Shouldn't this all be in the issue tracker?"

  * Bugs, User Stories -> Issue Tracker
  * Daily Stand Up Meeting log ->

    *

Digital Stand Up Meeting Process Checklist:

- [ ] Create a collaboratively edited document ("live doc", "doc")

  * Realtime collaborative editors: Etherpad Lite, Google Docs
  * An example of :ref:`Three Questions` for stand up meetings
    (in :ref:`Markdown`, with :term:`URIs <uri>`, for GitHub, BitBucket):

    .. code::

Revision Control
++++++++++++++++++
| Wikipedia: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Revision_control

Revision control is a change management strategy for a project
repository.

* There is a better way than emailing which version
  of what the attachment was named
  before the re: subject line changed.

  * folders
  * file versions
  * usernames, change logs, signatures

* "Revision control" is synonomous with ":ref:`Version Control <vcs>`".
* Centralized :ref:`Revision Control Systems <revision-control>`:
  :ref:`CVS`, :ref:`SVN <subversion>`
* :ref:`Distributed Revision Control Systems <dvcs>`:

Bisection
~~~~~~~~~~~
| Wikipedia: `<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bisection_(software_engineering)>`_

Bisection is a method for determining which change causes a fault
(or a specific test to change from passing to failing or vice-versa).

Many bisection algorithms take a start and end ("between here and here")
and do a binary search ("this half or that half");
checking out each revision and running a script that
should return ``0`` for OK, or non-zero.
