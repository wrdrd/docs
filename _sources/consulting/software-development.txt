`````````````````
| Wikipedia: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stand-up_meeting#Three_Questions

 3. What obstacles are impeding my progress?

.. _digital stand up meeting:

Digital Stand Up Meeting
```````````````````````````
A Digital :ref:`Stand Up Meeting` is a meeting
conducted through digital means of communication;
rather than through traditional in-person communication.

Pros:

* **Links**: Realtime collaborative documents (*live docs*),
  team chat logs, and issue/ticket comment threads
  have URIs, are easier to remember,
  and more to the point.
* Easier to prepare for
* More time to read, think, and respond
* More comfortable
* Easier to get up to date with

Cons:

- It's not everyone in the same room
- "Shouldn't this all be in the issue tracker?"

  * Mailing Lists, Forums, :ref:`SIOC` <- Links to source, docs, issues
  * Bugs, User Stories -> Issue Tracker
  * Daily Stand Up Meeting log / **minutes** ->

    *

Digital Stand Up Meeting Process Checklist:

- [ ] Create a collaboratively edited document ("live doc", "doc")

  * Realtime collaborative editors: Etherpad Lite, Google Docs
  * An example of :ref:`Three Questions` for stand up meetings
    (in :ref:`Markdown`, with :term:`URIs <uri>`, for GitHub, BitBucket):

    .. code::

Revision Control
++++++++++++++++++
| Wikipedia: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Revision_control

Revision control, or *version control*,
is a change management strategy for a project repository.

* There is a better way than emailing which version
  of what the attachment was named
  before the re: subject line changed.

  * folders
  * file versions
  * usernames, change logs, signatures

* A *Revision Control System* (RCS) or *Version Control System* (VCS)
  is a software solution for handling change management
  with one or more project repositories.
* Centralized :ref:`Revision Control` Systems (RCS, VCS):
  
  * :ref:`CVS`, :ref:`SVN <subversion>`

* :ref:`Distributed Revision Control <dvcs>` Systems (DVCS):

Bisection
~~~~~~~~~~~
| Wikipedia: `<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bisection_(software_engineering)>`_

Bisection is a method for determining which change causes a fault
(or a specific test to change from passing to failing or vice-versa).

Many bisection algorithms take a start and end ("between here and here")
and do a binary search ("this half or that half");
checking out each revision and running a script that
should return ``0`` for OK, or non-zero.

Code bisection with :ref:`git`:
