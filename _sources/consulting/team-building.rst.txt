    Collaboration Engineering focuses on mission-critical collaborative tasks.
    A mission-critical task is one that creates substantial value, or that 
    reduces the risk of a substantial loss of value for organizational
    stakeholders. Collaboration Engineering further focuses on processes
    for mission-critical tasks
    that are recurring and must be executed frequently.
