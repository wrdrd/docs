GIF
~~~~~
| Wikipedia: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GIF

GIF is a file format for sequences of images ("animations").

GIFs appear to load quickly because there is no
media player or codec initialization time,
but are actually less eficient than compressed video (e.g. :ref:`H.264`)
because GIFs are not compressed
and contain every frame of the animation.

Video codecs compress the changes between frames,
in order to avoid basically GIF.

BitTorrent is a file distribution protocol built on top of :ref:`HTTP`.

* A BitTorrent client downloads pieces of files over :ref:`HTTP`
  from **peers** discovered through a tracker
  or another peer discovery protocol (such as a :ref:`DHT`).
* BitTorrent magnet URIs open in an installed BitTorrent downloading
  program (e.g. BitTorrent, uTorrent,
  Transmission (:ref:`Gnome`),
  Deluge (:ref:`Gnome`))
* There are programs to retrieve the latest ``.torrent`` files
  from RSS and Atom feeds (e.g. a released [episode] of a series or topic)
* BitTorrent can be run headlessly (as a server daemon) e.g.
  with an HTTP API, SMTP pattern, web interface, or SSH
  for enqueuing torrents to download to a central location.
* BitTorrent does not preserve file permissions or extended attributes,
  but archives can.
* For a time, BitTorrent accounted for the largest slice of web traffic;
  but "now accounts for only 6.3% of total traffic in North America".

.. glossary::

  BitTorrent Torrent File
    A BitTorrent ``.torrent`` file includes:

    * SHA-1 checksum hashes of all the pieces of all the files
    * (optional) a :ref:`DHT` key (for trackerless peer discovery)
    * (optional) a list of HTTP :term:`BitTorrent Tracker` URLs
    * (optional) a list of HTTP :term:`Web Seeds <web seeding>`.

    https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Torrent_file

  BitTorrent Tracker
    A BitTorrent Tracker maintains a list of recently connected
    peers from which matching pieces can be downloaded.

  BitTorrent Client
    A BitTorrent Client
    opens a :term:`BitTorrent Torrent File`,
    registers with the given :term:`BitTorrent Trackers <bittorrent tracker>`,
    looks for peers in a :ref:`DHT`,
    downloads the pieces of the files listed
    by choosing faster (more efficient, less costly, ~more local) peers
    to download from,
    and, according to the configuration, uploads pieces to other peers.

  BitTorrent Seed
    A BitTorrent Seed is a complete,
    checksummed copy of all of the pieces of all the files
    in a :term:`BitTorrent Torrent File`
    which a peer is sharing through a :term:`BitTorrent tracker`
    or a :ref:`DHT`.

  Web Seeding
    Web Seeding is when one or more
    :ref:`HTTP` servers serve default standby :term:`seeds <bittorrent seed>`
    (thus ensuring :ref:`Availability`
    when no-one is online).

  * Server [re]encodes stream and pushes video to other client(s)

* Browser-to-Browser (:ref:`webrtc`)

  * Clients connect in a mesh and relay data streams
  * Clients can be browsers or hosted applications (e.g. :ref:`SaaS`)
