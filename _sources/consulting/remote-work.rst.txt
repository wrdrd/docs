   **Telecommuting**, also called **telework**, **teleworking**, **working from home**
   (**WFH**), **mobile work**, **remote work**, and **flexible workplace**, is
   a work arrangement in which employees do not commute or travel (e.g.
   by bus or car, etc.) to a central place of work, such as an office
   building, warehouse, or store

   Plus, we value results, transparency, sharing, efficiency, and
   collaboration. With all that in mind, it just made sense that we
   would create an open source company Handbook. Our :ref:`Handbook
   <GitLab Handbook>` is actually under a Creative Commons license,
   meaning that as long you attribute GitLab youâ€™re free to copy and use
   it at will. We welcome you to do that if you wish! This way nobody
   has to reinvent the wheel.

Video Conferencing Procedures and Etiquette
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
- Ahead of time,
  verify that your camera and microphone work with the software
  that the team has chosen to work with.
- Have a plain text bullet point agenda.

  - If you're leading the meeting, have a bullet point agenda.
  - How long is the meeting expected to last?
  - Post the agenda in the text chat.
  - If you're participating in the meeting, it'll likely be very helpful
    if you have already prepared your :ref:`Three Questions`, for
    example.
  - If there are additional things you want on the agenda,
    your team may have formal rules for how to amend the agenda
    for specific types of meetings (i.e. status report, planning,
    performance review)

- Get consent and clarify whether the meeting is being recorded
  and how every team member can access the
  video, transcript, and text log of the meeting.
- Mute/unmute:

  - Mute when you're not speaking.
  - Unmute when you are speaking.
  - Unmute to indicate that you have something to say.

- Worse than partners, kids, pets in the background:
  watching you unprofessionally ask them to exit your space.
- For large meetings, it can be helpful to have a Code of Conduct
  to refer to before muting or booting a meeting participant.
- What should I wear?

  - You may need to get up to sign for a package or attend to
    something that may not require formal wear.

        Why am I wearing a tuxedo t-shirt today?

- Is video chat necessary, or can we rely upon emoji and written tone
  in a text chat that we can easily log and use verbatim
  as e.g. quarterly board minutes.
- Concurrent text-based chat:

  - Always paste the URLs to the resources that we're discussing.

Synchronous and Asynchronous Timing
------------------------------------
- The team may be working in different :ref:`time zones`.
- Minimize the amount of time spent idling
  by having asynchronous :ref:`Remote Work Processes` for handing off work
  and requesting feedback. What else can you work on while you're
  waiting for feedback or a scheduled call/chat? Refer to the
  already-prioritized backlog.
