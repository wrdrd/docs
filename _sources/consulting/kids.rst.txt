  due to: legally authorized requests for information,
  security vulnerabilities,
- Information asymmetry is an assumption that tends not to hold over
  time. Is quantum information ever lost?

  There was a bill specifically prohibiting such sale,
  which has since been cancelled by the current FCC administration.
- Law, Terms of Service, and Privacy Policies define how
  you and your kids' information can be used to pay for the cost of a
