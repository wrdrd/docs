  assuming privacy on the internet is a bad assumption
  due to: legally authorized requests for information,
  security vulnerabilities,
- Information assymetry is an assumption that tends not to hold over
  time. Is quantum information ever lost?

  - "Why Quantum Information is Never Destroyed | [PBS] Space Time"
    https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HF-9Dy6iB_4

  There was a bill specifically prohibiting such sale,
  which has since been cancelled by the current FCC administration.
- Law, Terms of Service, and Privacy Policies define how
  you and your kids' information can be used to pay for the cost of a
  service.
- There is need to investigate the world.
