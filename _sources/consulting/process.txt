Email attachments can be hard to find.

Versioned shared storage folders are so much easier to work with.

An email with a link to the (updated) files is helpful.


Mailing List

    Please sift through these n forwarded messages

For bringing new team members onboard,
it's much easier to archive a mailing list
and share links to specific emails and threads
than to be forwarding and remembering to CC people.

As team correspondence,
the context for a mailing list may be a bit less informal.

One continuous thread may very well be sufficient
and easier to scroll through. For this reason it's helpful to put
some forethought into the subject of the initial email message.

Keeping in mind the DRY principle and that it's possible to cross-post
(x-post) a link to another message, some other ways to organize threads:

* One thread per team (e.g. design, development, marketing)
* One thread per objective (e.g. objectives, updates, followup)
* One thread per meeting (e.g. scheduling, planning, minutes, followup)


To keep volume down and everyone on the same page,
sometimes it's easier to address everyone at the same time.

Project Site

Not strictly necessary, but helpful as a central collaboration point.

Links to:

* contact information
* shared folders
* mailing lists
* team calendar
* works in progress
* roadmap with dates and links to deliverables

TODO: Document-based collaboration
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Coming from a software development perspective, where:

* all changes are stored in version control
* all changes are tagged with an author
* everyone has access to central storage of every version
* each change affects a concrete set of files
* anyone can create a patch or submit a pull request to share their
  suggested modifications

Emailing document attachments is a wasteful way to
collaborate.

> What version am I working on?

> Who wrote this?

> When was this change proposed?

> What did it look like before the merge?

Online office suites with live collaboration can be much more
productive in that it's possible to review how something developed; 
but I like my distributed version control for good reason.

Who better to work out effective methods for online collaboration than
software developers?

To this end, I propose a few simple processes for avoiding time wastage
on document presentation:

* Contact Information Page (derived from a mailing list thread)
* Mailing List for archiving and relaying team correspondence
* Shared Storage with web interface and access control
* Project Site with WYSIWYG editor (derived from and driving mailing
  list activity)

  * Contact Information
  * Goals / Objectives / Roadmap
  * Team Policies / Procedures

    * scheduling a meeting
    * sending progress notifications
    * sharing meeting minutes

  * Shared Storage Folder
  * Calendar Widget

    * drawing from a calendaring system with iCal that I can overlay
      onto my other calendars

Web
----

.. glossary::

    Web Page
        A single ("static") HTML page.

        https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Web_page

    Website
        A set of interlinked HTML pages. Also used to refer to a web page.

        https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Website

    Web Application
        A software application running on a hosted server which returns
        responses to specific requests. May interact with a database,
        email services, etc.

        Works with variable data inputs and outputs.

        https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Web_application

    Web Hosting Service
        A service providing virtual or physical server resource space
        for a web page, web site, or web application.

        https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Web_hosting_service

    IP Address
        A number identifying a particular network entity (e.g. ``127.0.0.1``)

        We are running out of 32-bit IPv4 addresses (``127.0.0.1``),
        and are now moving toward 128-bit IPv6 addresses (
        ``0000:0000:0000:0000:0000:0000:0000:0001``, ``::1``)

        Certain IP addresses are locally-routable (e.g. ``192.168.0.1``
        within a home LAN)
        while others are globally-routable (e.g. ``8.8.8.8``
        through the internet).

        https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IP_address

    Domain Name
        A human-readable textual name for a network entity
        (e.g. ``example.org``)

        https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Domain_name

    DNS
        Domain Name System. Converts a domain name into an
        IP address (e.g. 127.0.0.1 (IPv4) or ::1 (IPv6)).

        Initial DNS hosting costs are often covered by Web Hosts.

        There are DNS record types for different types of services.

        Surfing to a website in a browser
        may utilize A, AAAA, and/or CNAME records to lookup the IP
        address of the web server.

        Sending an email utilizes an MX record to lookup the IP address
        and sender information for the mail host.

        Updates to DNS settings can take as long as 86400 seconds (one
        day) to propagate, depending upon the DNS TTL.

        https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Domain_Name_System

    URL
        Uniform Resource Locator. A string of characters that identify
        a particular (view of) a resource.

        ::

            scheme://host:port/p/a/t/h?query#fragment

        Where ``host`` is an IP address, hostname, or domain name.

        With an http scheme, the default port is 80.

        With an https scheme, the default port is 443.

        https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Uniform_resource_locator

    Web Browser
        A software program which visually renders resources
        identified by a URL and interprets scripts.

        Examples: Internet Explorer, Mozilla Firefox, Google Chrome

        All web browsers support HTML.

        Many web browsers support images like GIF, JPEG, PNG, and SVG.

        Many web browsers support Javascript scripts.

        Web browsers work with a DOM (Document Object Model).

        https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Web_browser

    DOM
        Document Object Model. Can be thought of as an outline of
        the objects in a particular document
        (e.g. text, shapes, images, videos).

        Different web browsers interpret the DOM differently,
        depending on Web Standards and individual implementations.

        https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Document_Object_Model

    Web Standard
        An agreed-upon standard specification for web things
        (e.g. HTTP, HTML, XHTML, HTML5, CSS, Javascript, SVG)

        https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Web_standards




Web Design
~~~~~~~~~~~

Web Layout
+++++++++++
A box-model composition of DOM objects, their styles, and their
behaviors at various screen sizes and resoultions.

Different browsers implement the DOM, HTML, CSS, and Javascript
differently. It is necessary to test a web layout in the browsers which
are utilized by the target audience.

In general, a simpler page renders faster and more
consistently.

Some users may be browsing without Javascript (either because their
very classic web browser doesn't support it, or, optionally,
because of security concerns introduced by active page scripts). Because
of this, it's usually best to not rely upon Javascript for page layout
and instead work with pure-CSS implementations.

CSS framework developers specialize in developing CSS grids and layouts
which work across browsers, devices, and various screen sizes.


* https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Page_layout
* https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Web_design#Page_layout
* https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CSS_frameworks
* https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Responsive_Web_Design
* https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_displays_by_pixel_density


Image Based Layouts
````````````````````
At first glance, it may seem that an image-based layout with fixed
dimensions (as might be developed in a traditional graphic design program)
would be simpler as easier. However:

* an 800px wide image layout is hardly usable on a mobile device
* search engines and screen readers are unable to read text embedded
  within images; necessitating `alt` attributes on `<img>` tags and `title`
  attributes on `<a>` tags
* When scaled (by zooming in), raster images like JPEG, PNG, and GIF
  look blocky and pixelated

Practically, it is not possible to develop a responsive web layout which
supports diverse screen sizes and resolutions with traditional graphic
design tools. It is far more consistent and reproducible to start with
an HTML web page and a CSS framework and then develop a template from
there.


Screen Captures
++++++++++++++++
There are many tools and services for collecting screen captures (or
screen shots) of web layouts.

Features to look for:

* Capturing the visible area of the page
* Capturing the whole page
* Setting the browser resolution

Some Javascript testing tools and services support taking screen captures
and movies at various points in a testing workflow.


Bootstrap

Criteria
~~~~~~~~~
* ROI (Returns/Cost :: Output/Input)
* Need / Want
* Maintainability

ROI
++++
The investment should be justified by gains in productivity / efficiency.

Productivity / Efficiency::

    output / input

Hours, Units, Dollars

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Productivity


Need / Want
++++++++++++
Communication and collaboration are essential to success.

Maintainability
++++++++++++++++

Choosing Components

* In n-years, will I be able to find someone who can maintain this?

  * Locally? Globally?
  * Job listing keyword search [rough approximation]
  * Job board search

* In n-years, will there still be a community supporting these
  components?
* Is it open source? How do we find/pay/train someone to understand
  how it works?
* Is there a *non-profit* software foundation behind this component?


Clouds
~~~~~~~
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cloud_computing

Why would I want to run my business "in the cloud"?

What are our core competencies?

Do we need/want to run this all ourselves?

Would it be more safe/secure to outsource the management of these
business systems?

Application layers:

* Application
* Platform (Database, APIs)
  * # TODO: define API (OS API, Infrastructure API, Web API, Language API)
* Infrastructure (Physical and Virtual Servers)


Software-as-a-Service
+++++++++++++++++++++++
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Software_as_a_service

Example: GMail is software hosted as a service on Google's
infrastructure; there's no need to internally pay for and manage servers in a
datacenter anywhere.

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Application_service_provider


Platform-as-a-Service
++++++++++++++++++++++
Platform-as-a-Service providers abstract a bit further in that they
provide an implementation of platform APIs on top of which applications
can be developed and hosted.

Heroku, AppEngine and AppScale are examples of Platforms-as-a-Service.


Infrastructure-as-a-Service
+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++
Infrastructure-as-a-Service providers provide a bit more than regular
hosting services in that they offer something like virtual datacenter
resources.

Amazon Web Services (AWS), Rackspace, and Google Compute Engine
are examples of
Infrastructure-as-a-Service: they provide servers, networks, and
redundant storage systems on top of which IT systems can be 
developed, tested, and deployed.
