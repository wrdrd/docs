**************
| Source: git https://github.com/taavi/ipython_nose

ipython_nose is an extension for :ref:`IPython Notebook`
(and TODO probably :ref:`Jupyter Notebook`)
for discovering and running test functions
starting with ``test_``
(and TODO ``unittest.TestCase`` test classes with names containing ``Test``)
with :ref:`Nose`.

.. note::

    .. code:: python

        x = 2

        # these get compiled out with python -O2
        assert x == 2

        # these always run
        # self = unittest.TestCase
        self.assertEqual(self, x, 2)

nbgrader
*********
| Source: git https://github.com/jupyter/nbgrader

:ref:`Jupyter notebooks <jupyter notebook>`
can be submitted and centrally graded with nbgrader.

.. note:: While it's possible to run tests of all code cells
   in a Jupyter notebook, by



 it's usually preferable to factor
   testable code into a module and a package
   (e.g. :ref:`Python Package <python packages>`, :ref:`Conda package <conda>`)
   and then reference those tested functions from within
   :ref:`Jupyter Notebook`.

runipy
*******

| PyPI: https://pypi.python.org/pypi/runipy

runipy runs :ref:`Jupyter notebooks <jupyter notebook>`
from a :ref:`Shell <shells>` commandline, generates
:ref:`HTML` reports,
and can write errors to stderr.

:ref:`Jupyter notebook <Jupyter Notebook>` *manual* test review process:

.. code:: python

    !jupyter notebook
    # - (optional) click 'Cell' > 'All Output' > 'Clear'
    # - click 'Cell' > 'Run All'
    !git diff mynotebook.ipynb
    !git add mynotebook.ipynb
    !git commit mynotebook.ipynb -m "TST: mynotebook: tests for #123"


:ref:`Jupyter notebook <Jupyter Notebook>` runipy review process:

.. code:: python

  !runipy mynotebook.ipynb
  web ./mynotebook.ipynb.html
  for (i, o) in notebook:
      human.manually_review((i, o))
  !git diff
  !git diff mynotebook.ipynb*
  !git add mynotebook.ipynb*
  !git commit mynotebook.ipynb* -m "TST: mynotebook: tests for #123"
