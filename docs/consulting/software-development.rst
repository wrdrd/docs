Three Questions
`````````````````
| Wikipedia: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stand-up_meeting#Three_Questions

 1. What did I accomplish yesterday?
 2. What will I do today?
 3. What obstacles are impeding my progress?


.. index:: Digital Stand Up Meeting
.. _digital stand up meeting:

Digital Stand Up Meeting
```````````````````````````
A Digital :ref:`Stand Up Meeting` is a meeting
conducted through digital means of communication;
rather than through traditional in-person communication.

Pros:

* **Links**: Realtime collaborative documents (*live docs*),
  team chat logs, and issue/ticket comment threads
  have URIs, are easier to remember,
  and more to the point.
* Easier to prepare for
* More time to read, think, and respond
* More comfortable
* Easier to get up to date with

Cons:

- It's not everyone in the same room
- "Shouldn't this all be in the issue tracker?"

  * Mailing Lists, Forums, :ref:`SIOC` <- Links to source, docs, issues
  * Bugs, User Stories -> Issue Tracker
  * Daily Stand Up Meeting log / **minutes** ->

    *

Digital Stand Up Meeting Process Checklist:

- [ ] Create a collaboratively edited document ("live doc", "doc")

  * Realtime collaborative editors: Etherpad Lite, Google Docs
  * An example of :ref:`Three Questions` for stand up meetings
    (in :ref:`Markdown`, with :term:`URIs <uri>`, for GitHub, BitBucket):

.. _user story:

User Story
~~~~~~~~~~~~
| Wikipedia: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User_story

A user story is a couple of simple sentences expressing desired
competencies, features, or behaviors of a system.

Ideally, user stories can simply be transformed to e.g. :ref:`TDD <tdd>`
and :ref:`BDD <bdd>` tests.

Example user stories:

   * "[role] can [action [objects]] [in order to / so that [...]]"
   * "Users can login and post Things with a description and a url"
   * "Users can login and post Things with a description and a url
     in order to have something with a URL to share"
   * "Users can share shared Things with a URL"

* User story formats

``````````````````````````````````
| Wikipedia: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User_story#History
| Docs: http://ronjeffries.com/xprog/articles/expcardconversationconfirmation/

The Three C's of :ref:`User story` :ref:`requirements modeling` are
**Card**, **Conversation**, and **Confirmation**.

* Card

  * Issue ``name`` and ``description`` (or
    ``description__markdown_github``).
  * :ref:`Codelabels`

* Conversation

  * Issue comment thread or **threads** (with full URLs)
  * Pull Request comment thread or **threads** (with full URLs)
  * :ref:`Codelabels`

* Confirmation

  * Issue ``status``: open / closed
  * Issue Labels: { duplicate, wontftix }
  * Issue labels: { ready, in progress, } TODO

    * https://waffle.io/ uses ready, in progress labels
      to build an interactive :ref:`Kanban` board with columns
      from github issue labels.


.. index:: Use Case
.. _use case:

Use Case
~~~~~~~~~~
| Wikipedia: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Use_case

A use case describes actions, actors, and goals.

* :ref:`UML` defines a formal model for :ref:`Use cases <use case>`
  and use case diagrams.

  * Use case diagrams may involve **stick figures**
    as symbols for **actors**.

* In practice, the use case is a more formal requirement model than the :ref:`user story`.

  * In terms of process workflow, a
    :ref:`Use Cases <use case>` could be derived from zero or more
    :ref:`User Stories <user story>`.
  * There are many :ref:`domain modeling` tools for e.g. :ref:`UML`;
    each with various levels of support for *round-trip* between
    modeling tool and e.g. code that you add after transforming to which
    is sometimes referred to as *stub* code.


.. index:: Requirements Traceability
.. _requirements traceability:

Requirements Traceability

| Wikipedia: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Requirements_traceability

* :term:`URLs <URL>`

  * issue numbers (GitHub, BitBucket, ):

    * ad-hoc (the numbers probably won't be sequential)
    * issue ``#1``: Mission, Project list
    * issue ``#2``: Project
    * issue ``#3``: Goal
    * issue ``#4``: an Objective for goal ``#3``

      * With a fixed, preallocated numbering system,
        this would be e.g. ``project:3.1``;
        however, issue ticket numbers are sequential by order of
        creation

        * the numbers would then appear somewhat arbitrary
        * there would be no need to renumber things

Revision Control
++++++++++++++++++
| Wikipedia: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Revision_control
| Docs: :ref:`Tools > Version Control Systems <vcs>`

Revision control, or *version control*,
is a change management strategy for a project repository.

* There is a better way than emailing which version
  of what the attachment was named
  before the re: subject line changed.

  * folders
  * file versions
  * usernames, change logs, signatures

* A *Revision Control System* (RCS) or *Version Control System* (VCS)
  is a software solution for handling change management
  with one or more project repositories.
* Centralized :ref:`Revision Control` Systems (RCS, VCS):

  * :ref:`CVS`, :ref:`SVN <subversion>`

* :ref:`Distributed Revision Control <dvcs>` Systems (DVCS):

Bisection
~~~~~~~~~~~
| Wikipedia: `<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bisection_(software_engineering)>`_

Bisection is a method for determining which change causes a fault
(or a specific test to change from passing to failing or vice-versa).

Many bisection algorithms take a start and end ("between here and here")
and do a binary search ("this half or that half");
checking out each revision and running a script that
should return ``0`` for OK, or non-zero.
