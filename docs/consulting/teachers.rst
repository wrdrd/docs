Schema.org for Education
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
You can add tags to :ref:`HTML` pages (and :ref:`JSON-LD` documents)
that search engines can index.

:ref:`Schema.org` is an :ref:`RDFS` vocabulary with classes and
properties; for example: ``AlignmentObject`` and
``educationalAlignment``.

When you *dereference* a schema.org :ref:`URI` with a web browser,
there is a corresponding web page describing the term
and, in many cases, listing examples of how to use the markup
in :ref:`Microdata`, :ref:`RDFa`, and :ref:`JSON-LD`:

- https://schema.org/learningResourceType
- https://schema.org/audience
- https://schema.org/educationalAlignment
- https://schema.org/AlignmentObject
- https://schema.org/Course
- https://schema.org/CourseInstance

Search engines index all three formats.

.. note:: While the schema.org vocabulary pages are available over
   :ref:`HTTPS`,
   when you reference a schema.org class, you reference the
   :ref:`HTTP` link.

Many of the schema.org education terms came from the
:ref:`LRMI` project.

Clean Language

- Symbolic Modeling:

  - We think in metaphors -- it's apparent in our language.
  - A person's understanding of the world is rooted in their symbolic
    landscape.
  - Different learners have different metaphorical conceptions.

- Clean language:

  - MAPS: Metaphors, Assumptions, Paradigms, or Sensations
  - Different ways of saying the same thing:

    - As teachers / coaches / counselors,
      we can be most effective by recognizing others' symbolic metaphors
      and working from there.
    - As teachers, our job is not to impose our metaphors on others.

  - Clean Language offers a few standard question forms ("clean
    questions") for maximizing growth in understanding.
