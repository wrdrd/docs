Jupyter and Education
=======================
:ref:`Jupyter` Project is great for education

* :ref:`Jupyter Notebook` (:ref:`IPython Notebook`)
* :ref:`ScipyStack` (see: :ref:`Anaconda`)
* Jupyter Notebook supports over 43 languages other than :ref:`Python`
* Jupyter notebooks can be published as HTML, PDF, ePub, MOBI
* Jupyter notebooks can be published as reveal.js HTML slide presentations
* Jupyter notebooks can be published to and served directly from GitHub repos
* Jupyter notebooks can be published as edX courses

  * http://mail.scipy.org/pipermail/ipython-dev/2015-February/015911.html
  * https://github.com/topocm/topocm_content/
  * edX is also mostly written in :ref:`Python`

* Jupyter notebooks can be submitted and centrally graded with nbgrader:

  https://github.com/jupyter/nbgrader

* Jupyter notebooks can be saved to and read from Google Drive

  https://github.com/jupyter/jupyter-drive

* Jupyter notebooks are great for taking notes
