  [ ] Can I (send you a) ``tweet`` you sometime?

  [ ] What's your Twitter [(optional) username / handle / :ref:`URL`]?

- When you add ``@username`` (with the ``@`` *at* symbol,
  the username is then linked and added to a notification list.

  Tweets that start with ``@username`` show in the "Tweets & replies"
  Twitter User Profile view.

  Tweets that start with ``.@username`` show in the "Tweets"
  Twitter User Profile view; may be linked replies; and still do send a
  notification to ``@username`` and any other ``@``-addressed Tweeters.

- When you add ``#example`` (with the ``#`` *hashtag* symbol) before a word
  -- like in :ref:`IRC` clients and old :ref:`BBS` systems --
  the hashtag becomes a link to a current search for
  other tweets containing that hashtag
  and/or similar terms
  (after the ``140 character`` limit).

  (e.g. regex ``#\w+``),
  except for Unicode; and Right-To-Left languages.
