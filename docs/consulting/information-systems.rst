Criteria
~~~~~~~~~
* ROI (Returns/Cost :: Output/Input)
* Need / Want
* Maintainability


.. _is-roi:

ROI
++++
The investment should be justified by gains in productivity / efficiency.

Productivity / Efficiency::

    output / input

Hours, Units, Dollars

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Productivity

See: :ref:`Business > ROI <business-roi>`

Need / Want
++++++++++++
Communication and collaboration are essential to success.

Maintainability
++++++++++++++++

Choosing Components

* In n-years, will I be able to find someone who can maintain this?

  * Locally? Globally?
  * Job listing keyword search [rough approximation]
  * Job board search

* In n-years, will there still be a community supporting these
  components?
* Is it open source? How do we find/pay/train someone to understand
  how it works?
* Is there a *non-profit* software foundation behind this component?


Clouds
~~~~~~~
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cloud_computing

Why would I want to run my business "in the cloud"?

What are our core competencies?

Do we need/want to run this all ourselves?

Would it be more safe/secure to outsource the management of these
business systems?

Application layers:

* Application
* Platform (Database, APIs)
  * # TODO: define API (OS API, Infrastructure API, Web API, Language API)
* Infrastructure (Physical and Virtual Servers)


Software-as-a-Service
+++++++++++++++++++++++
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Software_as_a_service

Example: GMail is software hosted as a service on Google's
infrastructure; there's no need to internally pay for and manage servers in a
datacenter anywhere.

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Application_service_provider


Platform-as-a-Service
++++++++++++++++++++++
Platform-as-a-Service providers abstract a bit further in that they
provide an implementation of platform APIs on top of which applications
can be developed and hosted.

Heroku, AppEngine and AppScale are examples of Platforms-as-a-Service.


Infrastructure-as-a-Service
+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++
Infrastructure-as-a-Service providers provide a bit more than regular
hosting services in that they offer something like virtual datacenter
resources.

Amazon Web Services (AWS), Rackspace, and Google Compute Engine
are examples of
Infrastructure-as-a-Service: they provide servers, networks, and
redundant storage systems on top of which IT systems can be 
developed, tested, and deployed.
