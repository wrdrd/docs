| PyPI: https://pypi.org/project/farmOS
| NPM: https://www.npmjs.com/package/farmos
| Docs: https://farmos.org/

    farmOS is a web-based application for farm management, planning, and
    record keeping. It is developed by a community of farmers,
    developers, researchers, and organizations with the aim of providing
    a standard platform for agricultural data collection and management.

    - The farmOS server is built on top of :ref:`Drupal` in :ref:`PHP`.
    - The farmOS Field Kit app provides offline data entry in a native
      :ref:`Android`/:ref:`iOS` app, and as a progressive web app
      (:ref:`PWA`) at farmOS.app.


- FarmOS Data Model
  | https://farmos.org/model/

  Data Model according to the farmos.py docs re: what can be accessed
  from the Drupal/FarmOS HTTP API with the farmOS Python client;
  the actual docs are more complete than the (Python, JS) API client docs:

  - Logs: A log is any type of event that occurs on the farm, from a
    planting to a harvest to just a general observation.

  - Assets: Assets are any piece of property or durable good that
    belongs to the farm, such as a piece of equipment, a specific crop,
    or an animal.

  - Areas: An area is any well defined location that has been mapped in
    farmOS, such as a field, greenhouse, building, etc.

  - [Taxonomy] Terms: FarmOS-install-configurable terms for various
    categorization purposes. E.g. quantity units, crops/varieties,
    animal species/breeds, input materials, and log categories. See
    "Endpoints" above for specific API endpoints URLs.

.. index:: Electric Lawn Equipment
.. _electric lawn equipment:

Electric Lawn Equipmentn
=========================
- Combustion produces CO Carbon Monoxide, which is an *oxidant* "free radical"
  that binds with many things easily (due to valence electrons).

  Burning wood, oil, and gas produces byproducts including Carbon
  Monoxide,
  which are not good for anyone,
  and particularly unhealthy for persons with e.g. asthma.

  Combustion occurs particularly when the carbon bonds break at low heat.

  A (fluidic) "flame" that we'd see in Earth air *which has oxygen* is
  either combustion or plasma. Plasmas are different state of matter.
  Combustion is a critical reaction where the carbon bonds keep breaking
  due to the locally-freed thermal energy; and the other particulate is
  typically thermally ejected into the surrounding fluid without
  a sustainable filtration system.

- First Berkeley/Oakland, CA, USA and then the State of California
  have banned sales of new gas lawn equipment;
  you can only buy electric lawn equipment in stores is the plan
  in CA, USA first.

- You can buy lawn equipment that uses the same batteries as your power
  tools so that you only need so many multi-battery chargers.

  - [ ] TODO: :ref:`USB-C PD` for Tool vendors (@DeWalt, )

    - Use case: A Squid-like charger with (reversible :ref:`USB-C`) ports
      on the batteries would be real nice but not as easy to carry as a
      pail with a handle and a physical battery pack interface spec.

    - Use case: Use extra tool batteries as spare USB power packs

    - [ ] Physical battery pack interface; there are a bunch of
      vendor-to-vendor adapters on e.g. amazon and there could be an
      optional spec and adapters for using old batteries with new tools

    - [ ] Battery reconditioning requires fire suppression to be safe
      for zoning, from what I understand.

.. warning::
