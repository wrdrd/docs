* https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gift_tax_in_the_United_States

  * In the USA, in 2015, you must pay gift tax
    on any amount over $14,000 (per donor, per beneficiary).

    * So, two parents, for example, must pay taxes on any amount
      over $28,000.

      * Gift tax does not apply to e.g. trusts and, for example,
        direct payments for e.g. school tuition.

        * This affects eligibility for financial aid.

          + It is more complicated than this, but, **roughly**,
            *if there is not a more specific will*,
            the first matching class takes everything (after debts are
            paid and then federal (and state) estate taxes):

.. note:: If the default state order of succession applies
   (e.g. when there is no other will defined),
   for one matching class to gift all or part of their inheritance
   to others, they then must pay *both* :ref:`inheritance tax` *and*
   :ref:`gift tax` on any amount over the annual exclusion for the year.
